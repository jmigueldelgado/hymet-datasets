## Download and process NCEP reanalysis

Something like this will work:

```
library(scraping)
coor <- data.frame(lon=13.40,lat=52.52)
var <- c('temperature','relative humidity')
years <- c('2000','2001')

request <- def_request(coor,var,years)

get_nc(request)

nc2rds(request)

```

Please have a look at the [vignette](vignettes/get_ncep_reanalysis.html) in a browser for more details.

## pluviopt
A [rvest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/) based package to harvest near real-time pluviometry data from SNIRH/Portugal.

Data is publicly available at [SNIRH](http://snirh.apambiente.pt/) from the Portuguese Environemntal Agency. Right now it is possible to obtain rainfall data from the telemetry database. Objective is to make it easier to retrieve data from the website directly into an R workflow. Work in progress...
